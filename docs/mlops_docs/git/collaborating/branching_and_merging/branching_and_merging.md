A **branch** could be interpreted as an individual timeline of our project commits.

With Git, we can create many of these alternative environments (i.e. we can create different **branches**) so other versions of our project code can exist and be tracked in parallel.

That allows us to add new (experimental, unfinished, and potentially buggy) features in separate branches, without touching the '*official'* stable version of our project code (which is usually kept on the **master** branch).

When we initialize a repository and start making commits, they are saved to the **master** branch by default.
