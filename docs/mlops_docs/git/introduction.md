This git documentation is mostly based on [Atlassian's Git Tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tu
torials/) and [Colt Steele's Learn Git in 15 Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE).


## Dummy Repository

I created two dummy repositories to demonstrate the git workflow. The first repository is called 
`git-tutorial` and the second is called `git-sample-workflow`.

The [`git-tutorial`](https://github.com/reigHns92/git-tutorial) repository demonstrates the basic git 
commands.

The [`git-sample-workflow`](https://github.com/ghnreigns/git-sample-workflow) demonstrates the
git workflow for personal projects and how to collaborate with other people. Note that this repository
is created by my alternate account.
