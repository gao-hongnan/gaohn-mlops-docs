    "\n",
    "Before performing a commit to our local repository, there are a lot of items on our mental todo list, ranging from styling, formatting, testing, etc. And it's very easy to forget some of these steps, especially when we want to \"push to quick fix\". To help us manage all these important steps, we can use pre-commit hooks, which will automatically be triggered when we try to perform a commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Though we can add these checks directly in our **CI/CD** pipeline (ex. via GitHub actions), it's significantly faster to validate our commits before pushing to our remote host and waiting to see what needs to be fixed before submitting yet another PR. So the advantage of pre-commit over CI/CD checks is the speed of knowing your errors early, and to avoid excessive PR request should your commit fails."
