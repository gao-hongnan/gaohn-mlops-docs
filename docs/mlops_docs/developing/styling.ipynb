I believe the $79$ number stems from multiple reasons, one of which is many web browsers do not offer dynamic wrapping, and a super long line of code will turn out extremely ugly.\n",

This is where our `flake8` linter comes into play. Note that `black` won't catch this issue.\n",
        "- Our linter and formatter will also see another glaring issue, that is the `if` line is too long, exceeding the `PEP8` standard of $79$ length. Both `black` and `flake8` will tell us this, but `black` will perform an **in-place** treatment, formatting the code on the go for you, whereas `flake8` will just tell you.\n",
